# Introduction to WSL-Installer 🐧
WSL-Installer - or "InstallWSL.exe" -  is a free, open-source script converted to an EXE file that makes enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) easy, simple, and fast, utillizing the utility of Powershell to perform the installation commands.

## Installation 🐧
### To install, simply download the InstallWSL.exe file at http://bit.ly/2PBKuuL and run as a regular program in Windows 10. Requires elevation/administrative privileges in order to install WSL.
#### Notice: If you have an anti-malware or anti-virus solution running on your PC, WSL-Installer may run into problems, as WLS-Installer relies on running a batch script to install the runtime. You may want to consider temporarily disabling any and all anti-malware and anti-virus solutions while running this product.
